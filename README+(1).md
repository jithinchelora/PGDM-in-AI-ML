Shared Bike Demand Prediction with Linear Regression

# General Information

This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes using a provided dataset. The model helps a bike-sharing company, BoomBikes, understand the factors influencing customer demand and optimize their business strategy accordingly.

# Technologies Used:

Python
pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn

# Conclusions:

The developed linear regression model effectively predicts bike demand, explaining approximately 80.6% of the variance in the data (R-squared = 0.806). Several factors significantly influence bike demand:

Temperature (temp): A positive and substantial impact on bike rentals, indicating increased demand in warmer conditions.
Year (yr): A positive influence, suggesting growing popularity of bike-sharing services over time.
Weather situation (weathersit): A negative impact, implying that unfavorable weather conditions reduce bike demand.
Spring: A notably negative impact, suggesting lower demand during the spring season compared to the reference category (likely summer).
Windspeed: A negative but less pronounced effect on bike demand, indicating that high wind speeds slightly decrease rentals.
